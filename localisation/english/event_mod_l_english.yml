 reich.1.d:0 "TEST TEST THIS IS A TEST"
 rome.1.d:0 "Alessandra sat at her wooden desk, skimming through the countless sheets of paper she was expected to read and sign. Being the head of the Grand Council of Fascism was demanding work, even for someone groomed for the position all her life. One document, however, stood out amidst the stack of bureaucratic reports and decrees. It was an old police report from the 1960s—dated August 12, 1964, to be exact. The yellowed, stained paper detailed the events of that day, and though Alessandra had been barely two years old at the time, the memory was etched in her mind as vividly as if it had happened yesterday. That day, she and other members of the Duce’s family had been escorted to a villa on the outskirts of Rome by Blackshirts and officers of the army. At the time, she hadn’t known why, nor had she thought to ask. The small television in the living room where they sat remained on the entire time. After what felt like hours of waiting, the Emperor’s speech finally began to play. She could still recall how the broadcast unfolded. At first, it was ordinary—Umberto standing on stage, addressing the nation. Then, without warning, the camera shifted from him to the crowd, where it followed a group of armed men marching towards the stage. The sharp, echoing sound of gunfire cut through the transmission, and then the screen went dark. The living room had erupted into murmurs and hushed conversations among the adults, but Alessandra had stayed silent. She had been too young to understand the gravity of what had happened, instinctively knowing only to keep quiet. With a deep breath, Alessandra shook herself free from the pull of memory and set the old report aside. There was still a mountain of work left to tackle, and she couldn’t afford to dwell on the past."
