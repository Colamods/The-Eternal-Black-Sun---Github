 germanreich.1.d:0 "And where is your SS now, Walter? Barbie asked, resting one hand on the lavish armrest of his chair, positioned just meters away from the Führer, who was raising his right arm to the marching men below. Though the Führer did his best to appear strong and healthy, his wobbling knees and white-knuckled grip on the railing betrayed him. He was past his prime, and it was obvious.
The best comes last, Klaus, replied Rauff, his voice as cold and unyielding as ever. Barbie couldn't understand why the Führer would seat him next to Rauff as he so openly criticized the SS and its leadership. With a sharp exhale, Barbie turned his gaze back to the Führer, who was still standing, unsteady as he was. Barbie leaned toward Carius, seated to his right, and mumbled, "Look at him. How much longer do you think he’s gonna stand for? I mean, just look at—"
Barbie's words were suddenly cut off by a deafening bang. The crowd around the platform erupted in chaos as shouts, screams, and frantic trampling overwhelmed the noise of a second, even louder blast. Several officers rushed up the stairs behind the platform, throwing themselves onto the Führer, Busse, who was seated just half a meter away, and Neumann to Busse's right.
Barbie looked around in a panic, desperate for a hint of what was happening. Turning to ask Rauff, he was met with only confusion—Rauff was gone, vanished as if swallowed by the earth itself. Rising, Barbie gestured to an SS officer in the crowd who was shouting commands at the civilians scattering in all directions. Seeing Barbie's signal, the officer marched over and saluted, beginning to say, "Jawoh—" before Barbie cut him off.
"What is this?" Barbie asked, sounding almost indifferent to the mayhem around him. 
"I... I fear the Führer’s life was just threatened," the young officer stammered. Barbie stared at him, his face blank with confusion, before dismissing him with a flick of his wrist. Turning back to the Führer, he saw that several officers and doctors had already surrounded him—some trying to lift him, some yelling orders, and others simply standing in shock. For a moment, Barbie feared the unthinkable had come to pass.
Then he heard it—the familiar, frail cough of the ailing Führer.
He may have survived.
But Germany shall never recover."
